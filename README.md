# DiceRollerApp
The purpose of this app is to roll dice and display every dice roll, the highest roll and the total or all the rolls. This is my first
android app created with android studio. This was done as a project with the purpose of learning some of the fundamentals of android
development and to help make my life easier when playing board games. Other dice rollers do exist, but the ones that I have found all 
have complicated visuals that I find make it harder to see your exact rolls. This app uses a simple text output to display the information
to the user in the cleanest way possible. It also allows for things that many other dice rollers do not. It allows for dice faces to be any
number from 0 - 999. This is useful in games where you need to roll dice that have a zero face. You can also roll up to 300 dice at once, so
if you really need to roll a very large number it is possible here.
